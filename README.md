# codeware

Codeware is an online IDE for C++.

Built using NodeJS, ExpressJS and ReactJS!

### To run this project on your machine :

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/kritikmodi/codeware.git`.
2. The _backend_ folder contains the code for the REST API. Navigate to it and run it using `npm start run` or just `npm start`. It'll run on port 5000.
3. The _client_ folder contains the code for the frontend. Navigate to it and run it using `yarn start`. It'll run on port 3000.
4. Now the IDE is ready to use. Type some code in **C++** and click on the **Run** button to execute it.
5. That's it for now, but more features are in progress! :)
